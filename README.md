## [Code Fights](https://codefights.com)

### What is CodeFights?
CodeFights is as an online community where developers can practice their skills through a series of coding challenges.

### How does it work?
- In each algorithm you are given a description to solve. Check my repo for any of the markdown files to see the instructions.

- Tests given some public tests to view which means you can see the input and desired output. Hidden tests which can not be viewed are also given and will need to be solved. You have the ability to write your own tests for specific cases or to try and guess the hidden cases.

- Gold is provided for solving challenges which can be used to help solve algorithms by "buying" clues to the challenge.

### Viewing my work
- Each folder in this repo is a challenge I have solved on CodeFights. It will include two files, a README file which will provide the objective for the challenge and a file which will be the code I wrote to solve the challenge.
